# Details

*  The entire project broken up into small modules npm style so check at the wiki to find the other pieces like the QR code component

* Initially starting out with the Facebook Parse BAAS, which is open sourced later this year. Later this iOS module will transition to an open source login run on a SudoRoom server. 

* I'm just doing this on Parse for now to show the proof of concept.

* Start with Obj-C but transition to Swift
